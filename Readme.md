# Advent of Code 2023

I'm doing Advent of Code! Sort of. I will do some days, depending on time/interest.

Programming language used is Kotlin, I want to improve my Kotlin.

Be aware of spoilers, of course. As per AoC recommendations, I'll not push solutions until the leaderboard for the day is full.
